Nevertheless ended with a duck 😭,He got Tripathi out too,And SRH folded like papers today. So much hope and this is the result.,The real problem starts from 29th imagine both Australian Cummins and starc in final gonna play in the same team from 29 th it is going to be hard ......,Boult and starc have always been my favourite man. I really really love seeing them since that 2015 wc in Australia. The greatest bowlers of our generation 🙇🏻🙇🏻,Captainship matters too though, if it was Hardik Pandya, he would have taken the first over for himself in spite of having a Starc (or Bumrah) on the team, given like 20 overs and the momentum would have already been with SRH so no Starc or Bumrah can really turn around in the second over.

Ball hitting top of off stump is always a treat.,Delivery of 24.75 crores,The very thought that this is the Starc we will face in WC24 is giving me future nightmares,literal translation of paisa vasool lmao 😬,I don't think any batsman would have survived.

"Thank God someone asked this question, I was furious when this happened. KKR victory made me forget it.,
It just showed the quality of umpiring this season, utter bullshit.,They are lucky that this wasn't a game changing moment.. otherwise bogot bada danga ho jata,it might not have changed the result but it mattered dearly to Gurbaz ..,man he could have finished the match on his own after being benched for the whole IPL group stage .. a precious gift to his sick mother ..,No idea.,But I felt really bad for Gurbaz. He really wanted to finish the game.,Shit umpiring needs to show some mark in some form during the finals. Since the on-field umpires didn't get that chance, it was up to the technicians to make it up for that,I'm an SRH fan and I was shocked that they didn't check ball tracking yesterday. Idk why.  Shit umpiring. That wicket didn't matter though. Kkr was already winning.,It happened in some other match a few years ago as well right where a batter could not take DRS?

"Tbf it was a boring final to everyone thats not KKR. But a boring, easy final win is wet dream for every sports fan on the planet.,Winning a final in one side contest is huge. People who say otherwise are just salty beaches.,My reply to the boring final.,:31678::31666:,lol the way KKR played, they would have obliterated any other team. I stand by the fact that we are second best team this season.,Also, SRH fans were never going to hate on your team for winning. ,We are all genuinely grateful for our journey, and being mad at losing the final is just disrespectful of all the stellar cricket our team played.,As an RCB fan it was definitely a boring final. But the boring final is the biggest evidence that KKR was the most >! Deserving!< team for it this year.,It really was boring, but that's cuz we dominated them. This was a clash between the two best teams this year no doubt. As a kkr fan this game made me happy but I understand why pthers would find it boring lmao,Next time anyone wants less boring matches, bring us teams which are half as good as us 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️,I don't understand the logic behind ,.,I mean, yes, for people who've paid money for the tickets, I get it that you'd want a , match.,But if I'm a genuine supporter of a team which hasn't won the trophy in a long-long time, I'd much rather that my team plays a boring one-sided final and easily brings the trophy home rather than risking it just for a nail-biting 3 hours.,Being honest SRH have also humbled a fair share of those fanbase , so they did deserve to be in the finals. I mean RR literally were willing to give the match away to RCB if they performed even decently. ,The only team that looked out of place throughout the playoffs was RR, while SRH got outplayed and RCB had a really bad day against RR,lol don't they understand that by calling it a boring final they are actually complimenting kkr and kinda degrading their own teams by implying that their teams are not capable enough to dominate a final like kkr did? jokes on them lmao,It was a boring final and everyone agrees .,You guys outplayed us and played amazing cricket. Congratulations 🥳,Its the blue and yellow team fans only who are dissing so much when their teams were not even able to qualify. Then comes RCB who are salty asf that they did not win against RR. Idc who won in the finals as both of the teams deserved it one way or another. KKR is a terrifying team with their batting and bowling line up which dominated the match. The match was not boring it was just dominating.,Winning one sided is better than winning by 1 run as it shows they won by pure dominance not just by luck lmao,True it was boring lol,Why do you think it disregards kkr game or domination? We are fan of cricket before fan of any team. ,A good display of bowling does highlight the beauty of this game but it was just one sided affair from KKR bowlers. Low scoring thrillers like 2017 and 2019 finals are best examples when bowlers from both side contributed. Kkr just raw dogged srh to make it boring AF,I am CSK fan and I am pretty happy with KKR's success.,GG is Thala's true brother.He always performed whenever Thala needed him the most.(Finals of 2007T20 WC and 2011WC),GG ki trophy matalab humari trophy!,Srh fanbase are confident not ignorant,I don’t take lockdown kids and plastic fans who only view cricket as batsmen game seriously anyway,They just wanna see boundaries and last ball thriller final, completely ignoring the fact that what kkr has achieved is sheer dominance this season,My ears are deafened by the victory celebration, can't hear any nonsense. Except ofcourse, the love and brotherhood from SRH fans.,Nah bro as rcb fan I have excuse that if we had chased in vs rr we would have won, but the way kkr played fanal another 49 was sure there,I don't know which team those salty mfs support, but damn , KKR deserved the title and they won it , that's all,Kkr this ssn was as strong as mi 2020 (imo better ) and that years final was also boring nobody expected dc to win esp after first ball wicket,It was boring because you guys crushed them.,If some idiots want to cry about it, let them cry. ,Some fans are too immature and just want something to complain about everyday so just ignore them and move on.,:31678::31666::31666::31666:,There are no  ifs and buts in game dude.,I don't know why people in this sub love to generalise every fanbase bhai unko konse upvote mil rahe hai cmt mai sablog unke opinion ko garbage hi keh rahe hai phir bhi agar koi bolta hai to yeh gif bhejde unko-,A final isn't boring if there are dropped catches or misfields or golden ducks or runs leaked by the winning team or a fight on field that they can use to make chad sigma edits. Under such circumstances the thing gets dragged to the last over and these ""fans"" get their dream nail-biter finals. 
They don't see an all round performance like this, so they think it's boring.,It was not boring for srh,everyone got to bat,IT WAS BORING. If they won a thriller, you would've seen a lot more emotions while lifting the trophy. The harder it is to find your achievement, the sweeter it is.,You guys thought SRH fanbase will give hate? LMAOOOOOO,let's appreciate great bowling efforts also, not every match should be for batters only! bowlers ripping through a batting line up is also entertainment,From SRH fan, hands down for KKR play this final and season!,Srh wouldn’t hate on us they are generally very decent. Only these newly added success hungry folks are hating. Plus some fans of trophyless teams.,The second point. I didn't see a single post in the RCB subreddit.
We were happy about the qualification then sad about the loss.,But as far as the final goes it was boring from an entertainment perspective but kkr have been bloody good this season and it's a dream from most teams to Dominate opposition in the final,It was indeed a boring final for us neutrals as we were looking forward to some great contest between the 2 greatest teams of the season. ,But by no means was it any ""undeserving"".. if a team wins one sided, they are clearly the ""most deserving team"" of that season. ,And we all would prefer a one sided final if our team was playing to be really honest. ,KKR was alpha right from the start and had the best squad for all the conditions. ,It's just that people might have made plans to have a watchalong with their friends on a Sunday evening and the match turned out to be a bummer, that may be the only plausible explanation of it.,I mean it was a boring final. Even KKR fans can't dent that. But the other points salty for sure,I am in the minority who enjoys watching quality bowling over batting. The 1st innings was a delight to watch. I expected srh would fightback strong, but was fooled. Nonetheless the trance induced by kkr's bowling carried me through the match.,Bhai. Ignore karde. Ye Sab cup se bada ye kya.,T- Bro Just ignore it, its not like all this is bigger than the cup itself,I would give my life to have a boring final like this if my team was playing. It shows how strong your team is.,If I had a nickel for every time a tournament ended with stomp and boring yesterday, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice. (IPL and Dota 2),nah but SRH and KKR are bros fr,i barely see any hate its just KKR fans doing RR and shit talking other teams and getting called out.,

"Sensible fans exist in all franchises. If you look carefully you will find such posts in CSK, MI, RCB franchise subs as well.,You know you can make a post appreciating someone without bringing down someone else. ,Food for thought.,BTW well played KKR and SRH.,Bro even most RCB fans in their sub took their loss with a level head, same with csk fans after they were disqualified. It's after their loss with rr they gone full crazy mode because they think they have the license that they can blame RCB fans.,everybody knew KKR would win. Well it wasn't our season. We should just move on and look forward to Rise more next season than this season. Win or loss, always gonna support the #OrangeArmy,Don't want to beat my own chest but since you picked an example of my team, ill add this. sensible fans exist in every team and most of us know how to take a victory or loss in stride. A few vocal minority don't represent an entire fanbase. There were even some comments from SRH fans that were not in good taste after today's defeat too but that's not representative of their teams fan base. The truly passionate fan who loves the sport over teams knows better,There is a rising trend of RCB and CSK hating posts in this sub since yesterday I have noticed.,Ek team ke sensible fan ko dusre team ke chomu fan ko compare mat kar. No other team fans know how to take loss better than RCB fans. It's been 17 years without any trophy.,Yup, but not all CSK and RCB fans are like this generalising us like this will cause hate against all CSK and RCB for no reason.,What an idiotic post. If you cherry pick, you can find the sweetest fans and the most toxic fans for any fan base. You cannot generalise any one fan base like that. ,It's because of posts like yours that even sensible fans get riled up. Please grow up. ,You should've gone into individual subs and seen after every team got eliminated. For every hate, toxic post, there were 10 posts saying - damn we lost, but it's because we played bad. Let's see what went wrong. And this is true for ALL franchises. If you can't realise that, then God save you. ,And whoever fan you guys are should accept reality that you all are lowkey jealous of the fanbase csk and RCB has.. and the only thing you guys can do is seek validation keeping those two teams as reference.. get a life dude you can appreciate someone without degrading others.. mf bc mc,I mean, they got thrashed, what else can they say?,hmm?,Exactly. There were similar post in both RCB and CSK subs but all you guys won’t post it coz it won’t get you to harvest Karma. Despite of all the toxicity we also posted appreciation post and yet it went right under y’all s nose,When your team reaches finals by accident: so big achievement that you don't feel saddened by loss lol.
Would u have said the same if your team had lost by 2-3 runs or in the last ball?: you would be cursing some decision by umpire etc. : but u were so thoroughly defeated that u have nothing to complain about.,sensible fan but what is that username...,both RCB and CSK fans made similar posts in our/their own subs, OP is the one who needs to learn something here,Imagine putting up a performance like that in a FINAL how embarassing it would be for them just. Specially with the reputation that they went with. 
This will either destroy there confidence for next season also or charge them up more. Chances of the first thing happening is more .,I don't think KKR fans were going to harass SRH fans after winning. Not the same case with RCB.,Also, don't forget that RCB vs CSK was not even a playoff match. 😂,Username on the post in SRH subreddit 😂,The one with Kane Williamson DP was very much salty during the resurgence of SRH. So by your logic all SRH fans are like that huh ?..,well said pussy addict,Dude is addicted to something else how’d srh loosing disappoint him,Go and check CSK sub, we know how to take Ls no team has lost more finals than us,the  maturity and positivity both these fandoms possess is something to admire fr,Damn , finally some wise words from pussy addict,The fans whom you target this at will never understand. The maturity is replaced by toxicity in them. There are tons of sensible fans who'd just don't participate in such hate filled discussion.,The para vs the name,They even posted hateful post please share that also 😂,what about this ???,The problem is not the fans but the illiterate people who follow cricket. They tend to like big names in cricket, hence their obsession with dhoni kohli rohit. 
People who are hardly taught any morals, discipline, respect and civic sense tend to create such degenerated fandoms.,I am a huge RCB fan, never indulged with any ugly fan war, or insecure fights with other teams. Yes we exist, and in a large number too
But those incels outnumber us and hence are the face of our fandom.
Hate them.,CSK fans were super salty after that RCB loss.,More than the fans, the 3D glass player has to learn something.,Sure and a lot of Srh fans could learn a thing or two from the mature RCB and csk fans. What a useless post.,his username though ,OP is pussy addict,Why do you keep targeting csk and RCB ? To get more interaction?karma farming? ,The toxic RCB and csk fans are Kohli and Dhoni fans who care about players not the team. Even u have such fans who celebrated when SRH was scoring 250s and started shit talking when u started to lose.,You can find both sensible and stupid fans in literally all franchises, even some dumbasses from your franchise were being salty in this sub yesterday. Cherry picking 1 sensible post from 10 salty ones doesn't make your fanbase any better than any other fanbase.,All the best for the next season.,Bro needs to start an anger management course after that SRH shitshow. How is he able to stay calm. ,Just an objective evaluation. Years of losing has given a sense of patience and humbleness to SRH fans.,Cummins has WC trophy tell those morons to get out of delusional world,Not related but I love that username 😂😂😂,Ab 113 run banake hagne ke baad aur kya hi bola ja sakta hai.,How can people forget what he said at ahmedabad,Chats meh toh sabke team ke fans toxic hai,There are post like this for every CSK match in CSK sub. Stop generalising.,The username tho 😂,Well said @pussy_addictt,Me looking at the username of the OP of that post🤣🤣🤣🤣,Ab fandom bhi learn kare. Lmao, this is some delusional stuff,Look at his name dude,Pussy addict can't be wrong,The username though 💀,SRH fans are just really great..... I mean we Kolkata Fans have been talking all sorts of shits after winning ( Biriyani, Silencer and what not) but it's good for them to take the criticism at heart.,No hate to SRH as a team.... the country is just happy for Head and Cummins' tasting defeat.....,What is that username in original post.,I love the trend of MI fans calling other fanbases toxic. Doesn'r get old,There is no need to reply to such posts. Just say “Haa bhai teri laal” and move on.,Next year SRH win the Cup.,Accept MI , Csk and RCB every other team has sensible fans.,Don't get why people generalize a teams fanbase so much like yeah there is toxicity but not every single person who supports RCB or CSK is a toxic . It's all about the attention these fanbases get. I've seen some toxic srh fans on insta and some sensible ones too. People who support a certain team aren't gonna be the same. ,Pussy addict ... Is so calm,Not gonna take advice from a handle named pussy_addictt,Srh fanbase is lit. After the KL Rahul incident, we had so many people defending KL and commenting on his posts on Insta. They literally made a post on the sub to do so.,Respect to SRH fans,Yes let's all learn from pussy addict.,We are proud of you srh, it's okay to have a bad day. Wasn't expecting this after Q1, but whatever. And it feels so happy to see, kkr srh aren't catfighting like some 47cr viewership chest thumpers. Both are so mature and understanding and a true reflection of their team identity as well.,This is not surprising tbh. SRH has a really good fanbase, except some idiots. Except when they play against KKR, I usually like it when SRH wins matches. The same goes for GT, RR, LSG, DC, and PBKS. RCB is an exception on two levels: one as a KKR fan personally, and the other at a general level. They've a delusional toxic fanbase. Not all of them ofc, but most of them. I absolutely despise the egos of CSK and MI and their fans, but atleast they and their fanbases have a reason to be so arrogant. RCB fans tick neither of those boxes. The other teams are either suitably egoistical, or suitably modest usually,Don't be dumb, some srh fans are anti nationalists and want Aus to win.,Yep. Really heartfelt wholesome post by ,! 👍🌹,I read some RCB fans posted about the viewership of the final. How it was too less as compared to the RCB games. And how they are the most entertaining team in the IPL. Like dude just accept and move on what's the point of being salty 🤦🏻‍♂️
P.S Just like every other team ,  RCB also has good fans as well as bad fans.",https://i.redd.it/ijwxvf3vbu2d1.jpeg,This is how you take a loss. RCB and CSK fans need to learn something from them.,https://old.reddit.com/r/ipl/

"Srh's biggest fan. Sad to see hate comments on her and Pat Cummins. Been lurking on this sub for a while this season and all I saw was hate, no passion or respect for the sport (this is an exaggeration but still somewhat true). Even if you can't respect it, please at least be civil about it. Grow up.,Felt sad for her TBH. She is a passionate owner for sure. That there is real emotions and we have all been there when we can’t hold back our tears. Respect 🙏,She is actually a good girl, she held back her tears and clapped for kkr.,She is kind and knows sportsman more then everyone throwing hate on her here!!!,Wtf why r there so many hate comments??

I will avenge your team's honor (20 lakhs is enough for me lel),Shame on these broadcasters for constantly keep a camera on her, inspite of so much attention, she never misses a match and bravely sits there and cheers for the team. Her reactions are like that of a common person and not like ego ridden owners.,Being a KKR fan I am definitely happy for my team but I understand what SRH fans are feeling right now because we also had a similar journey in previous seasons. Speaking of SRH, imagine not performing for 3 seasons and then delivering the most explosive gameplay that no one can ever imagine of. Coming so close to victory and yet it all ends up like this. Afterall that's the harsh truth of leagues like IPL where every team is giving their best of efforts but at the end only one team wins. Thank you SRH for raising the standards of T20 format. See you next season !,Pathetic from the cameraman when she clearly has her back turned and definitely doesn't want to be filmed crying.. The Indian broadcasters have no ethics and empathy at all.,Rula Diya na Khan Sahab Ladki ko,Honestly it might seem an odd comparison and not trying to be disrespectful towards certain players but Kavya does show the difference between being passionate and being abusive.

It just wasnt their day. Next time maybe.,As non official team owner of CSK I can relate :""),The beauty is crying 💖,Most of the SRH fans had the same rollercoaster ride, sad and disappointed by the loss but appreciate the team for coming this far.

It worked for them most of the times which is why they went into the finals, but it is also a high stake strategy, which can go wrong at times. Yesterday was one of those days when it didn’t work. On the other hand KKR played all round cricket and almost their entire team stood up at diff times in the tournament. A well knit team with good leadership and management at the helm. Proud of our cup win after 10 yrs.,We should be absolutely demolishing these teams if we had good selectors and coaching. Clearly inferior teams but we end up in close matches. In the T20 world cup we should win every game by at least 20 runs or 10 balls. Nobody plays cricket outside the subcontinent and we still manage to lose to them.

"Most boring final & most dominated season by kkr,Call it boring or whatever. KKR dominated like hell after that horrible loss to PBKS.,Boring for cricket fans but exciting for kkr fans... but it was well deserved win for kkr,This is probably the strongest KKR has ever been even in 2014 they were struggling initially. Here it was like they were way above every other level,dominated so hard that we made the final boring.,
unreal shit.,Absolutely lovely final for a kkr fan!! Loved this one sided domination.,Thank god srh bottled the finals now rr vs gt is second most boring final,Now hire this MENTOR for the Indian team!,Match ended by 10.30 pm, one of the earliest endings this season. Totally dominated by KKR.,Blame SRH for the borint match kkr was at its all time best performance,Most Dominating*,Saying the most boring is like insulting KKR's efforts.,Strategic won by KKR this year.,Look at his fucking face. Man lives up to his name.,What a dominating final... This final showed dominance. Yess it wasn't a nail biting final, but that's what cricket is.. U never know it's not a reality show,mujhe toh as a SRH supporter ( after MI) 19 nov  ke flash backs aa gaye .,Most dominated tournament ever.,By far the most dominant season in IPL in a long time. ,Last time more points were scored in the league stage was by KXIP when they got 22 points in 14 games back in 2014.,The highest NRR ever in an IPL season.,K O L K A T A =7
Thala for a reason 🔥,If a team plays 10x better than the opponents then we can't offer you much entertainment. KKR is anyway habituated with ""boring"" matches. We knocked out RCB for just 49 runs.,Srh should have scored 280+ and KKR would have chased it by 18th over.,Boring ki jagah dominating zayada suit krta KKR ka dominance is season next level tha...,I really wanted SRH to score 250+ so that kkr Could chase it down easily.,Jo bhi bolo maza toh aaya 🤩,Blame the team, not the game.,Honestly,it was not boring 
I mean it would have been if kkr took 14-16 overs to chase the target 
But they did it within 10 overs only,It was boring because from the starting of ipl 2024 season Kkr dominated almost every team it played. In the middle of season Kkr faced a setback and then made comeback again by playing one sided match against each and every team.,Along with KKR the other 3 teams qualified for playoffs was too weak to even compete with KKR. This is was it made this season boring.,Ye GG kabhi hasega kya,It's a conspiracy by Jay Shah to make sure nobody calls the IPL fixed 🤣🤣,Vibes wise MI 2020 is most dominating but stats wise it's kkr 2024.,Most Dominated* would be the correct word,Idk about u but Mujhe to bada maza aaya final dekh ke.,Especially when it had srh, can't believe they made most 250+ scores in any ipl, blitzkrieg!!!,The boys just dominated too easily! Most boring? More like quickest.,They're like the Black horse of Ipl. No matter what happens they'll always have the potential to defeat the current strongest team regardless if they become the champion or not.,I mean they consecutively work 10 matches and most of those matches were one sided freak show ,So KKR has been soo good after 10 years and thanks to Iyer, mgmt and GG for making KKR strong,I think it was Rajasthan royals to some extent in the FIRST season, they only lost a few matches in the beginning. Later they hardly lost any,I have seen the third time such types of dominance by team in entire ipl history. 2008 - Rajasthan Royals, 2022 - Gujarat Titans, 2024 - Kolkata knight riders.,Don't know how you guys see this but this is the lowest total in a final in the history of IPL. So lads cheer up you may not support any team but don't demotivate others by saying it was boring. The bowling unit did their best in this final and you say boring... Then you are not able to entertain yourself.:31678::31666::31666::31666:,Up there with MI 2020 definitely. Nearly all players in form. 4 bowlers took around 20 wickets each. Rinku was disappointing but Russell didn't let it affect much. Narine the best he's ever been. Both Iyers playing responsible knocks when the top collapsed. Salt and Raghuvanshi played well. Ramandeep often the partner in crime for Russell.,I slept as soon as KKR crossed 10 overs in their batting. ,:X,Yes - SRH fan ,Absolutely fantastic season for KKR,Let me also see how they are going to retain all these players.....lol,Now shreyas be like koi akele trophy nahi jitata,so happy for kkr fans,for SRH fans may be,Both in Starc and Vaibhav's overs, the ball is swinging like crazy
This is why the bowlers are very important,Koi bhi credit iyer ko nahi deta... Sab sirf gg ko dete hai,1 chakke ne nahi ...2 chakko ne 2011 worldcup jitaya...

Former India and Mumbai WK batter and the most successful coach in the Indian domestic scene.,Yes he is true og,KKR choked srh into submission,:31678:,A very dominating season for KKR.

Bruh for me it was so satisfying, seeing Pat Cummins losing a final. I am happy Indian player won the trophy. It was worthy of a final for a bruised Indian fan after the world cup loss. Thoroughly enjoyed Cummins Head on the platter.,Most boring ipl final? Bruh for me it was so satisfying, seeing Pat Cummins losing a final. I am happy Indian player won the trophy. It was worthy of a final for a bruised Indian fan after the world cup loss. Thoroughly enjoyed Cummins Head on the platter.,Rajasthan Royals was playing Fantastically in the League matches but at the end, they seriously messed it up so bad 😒,When teams were making 400+ in each match people were mad about it, because flat pitches, run fest bla.. bla... when bowlers outclass batsman they are again mad about it, boring final. Just decide what you want.,Short answer, yes,Long answer, head and shoulder and miles above any other team in the tournament. Only Rajasthan looked to come close, but fizzled out halfway through. ,Every single KKR player was consistent. So much so, that heavyweights lijiye Rinku Singh and Russell were almost deemed irrelevant to the batting. The one match Manish Pandey came, in he contributed massively. Nitish Rana made a 22 ball 33. Angkrish Raghuvanshi came good in his absence. And the bowling... Can you imagine a bowling attack where the hero of the playoff and the final was the worst bowler in the team overall? KKR was invincible this season. Salt went out and it just didn't matter to the team composition. Dominance. Utter outright doninance,RR deserved to win.. 😢. They were going really good, but chocked,Hush now orange clowns,I think if it was csk or mi in the final and won it like this, no one would be saying it was a boring final or one sided but rather would have been appreciating the captainship of either teams and would be singing praise of the domination as it's something associated with mi and csk. But kkr did the same this season and everyone's like there is no hype and if it was the other way around everyone head over heels for mi and csk. Kudos to kkr for this dominating performance and shake the established powers in IPL.,Mumbai Indians 2020 was the most dominant side!!,Absolutely boring not Intersting at all I’m expecting a gud match but if it’s a league match that also boring but a true cricket fan agree with me that this is not the final we wanna see,When totka meets biryani 😂😂😂😂,Rigged ipl,It wasn't a boring final. That's what dominance looks like if it's not your team winning. ,We were used to mediocre bowlers before. So we always expected a last over finals. ,For once we have an actual World Class bowler who owns knockout stages and he actually did that.,If you are neutral then you should be happy that this league standard has gone up.,It looks boring to some people because everyone in KKR did their job so well, it need not have to be dragged to the last over. If some KKR bowlers fumbled and added more runs, if some KKR batters were out on zero, these last over victory enthusiasts would have had their dream final and would have stopped complaining.,I'm just confused about why GG gets credit for KKR's dominance. He is a mentor, not a coach.
No one praised Sachin (Mentor) when MI was dominant.,GG is a fine player (probably a fine mentor too) but I'm just confused why he should coach India when he doesn't even coach KKR.,Bhai mujhe Zara batana Shreyas ne kaha captaincy dikhai final me? ,Maine bhi wahi match dekhe Jo tumne dekhe",https://i.redd.it/772oh1rj0t2d1.jpeg,Top drawer stuff KKR and excellent captaincy by Shreyas.

Thank you Cricket. ❤️,Peak bowling performance by KKR. SRH should have taken to bowl first and tried to chase the target. Due to the collapse of openers, the pressure was so high on top and middle-order batsmen that they could not perform well. It was a completely boring match that didn't even feel like finals.

Thoroughly deserved!,Yipeee,Why is the dude on the left sucking dick?,If srh captain was Indian people would have obliterated him. But thankfully he is Aussie.,I expected CSK to beat RCB and go to the finals and then probably lose but no RCB got the chance and fumbled hard. At the least I wanted the season winners to be RR.,Instead it's KKR that won the season. Another cup to shut RCB fans. If SRH had won, same result. ,Don't worry RCB fans, your women's team will protect your honour by probably winning another cup for the team.,How does it feels like to win 🙏 ?,Very close match,Drake won his bet😂,Petition for GG to be India Team Coach ❗,Aami kkr,Gambhir ko coach banane k liye mujhe Thala ne hi bola tha -SRK",https://i.redd.it/s2qwg6zwws2d1.jpeg,Kolkata Knight Riders are the champions of IPL 2024.

"Kkr was a better team,Srh made it to finals bcz of cumdawg captaincy. ,Not every game can be won by captaincy when the opposition is in form and tactical as much as you,Before we praise one man, like GG would always say, praise everyone. Even he would want the same.,Not obsessed with individuals.this kkr team is better than prime 2020 MI,Ek MENTOR ne trophy nahi jeetwayi thi....,It's not an individual sport guyz. If it was ,everybody knows who would have most trophies. Start criticizing as well as giving credit to team not to an individual.,His exit from politics might be the part of a new move. He may be the next Indian coach.,KKR build this team in last 2-3 years,GG no doubt is emotion for us.But,this year we have every department checked.And luckily,with addition of Salt,the team was freaking outstanding.
But you can't deny that Cumdawg is one of the best captain,in the history of this game.SRH have few loopholes this year,but they overcome that and reached final,that is also amazing.
RR & CSK were unable to handle their loopholes this year, CSK got some bad luck with injuries.
RCB on the other hand, surprises everyone and they have played more than their capabilities in second half, considering the bowling attack.
DC- The selection of perfect 11 cost them this tournament, otherwise they were pretty strong side this year,Why no one giving any credit to Shreyas Iyer?
Its like everyone ignored him,No, KKR won as a team (includes staff). Don't undermine the team's effort.,i hate this one person worship thing (be it for gambhir, cummins, kohli, or dhoni). gautam gambhir is not the reason they won. he has been with the team for several years now, so why didnt they win in previous years? they were clearly the best team this ipl by a wide margin and while gambhir surely helped, he is not the reason they won,GG is a great mentor, his track record speaks volume, qualified for all playoffs as a mentor. And, let's stop giving whole credit to one man: they can uplift team, find right combinations and guide the team. It's collective contribution from players which makes a team lift trophies.  ,SRH heavily depends on Openers, if they don't score, mostly it's game over for them, as middle order is unreliable and doesn't contribute much, doesn't have any quality spinners, yet they somehow made this far, which is startling. KKR this season is easily one of the strongest team in IPL history. Almost all KKR players contributed in team success, as many where in form, consistently performing well for the side, they deserve to win this tournament.,Slumdog's dig at Cummins is deplorable; He struck fear in all opponents with his gameplay and approach. Also, his contribution towards SRH is unparalleled, consistently performing both with bat and bowl accordingly to need in hour. Cummins, Gambhir or anyone else needs a team, inform players to win ""Trophies"". period.    ,Cummins is highest scorer of SRH in today's match, there isn't much one can do, when others aren't contributing and assisting him from other ends(bat & bowl). Whether you like him or not, he is a fascinating cricketer and a champion. ,Congrats to KKR!,Kkr captain,, got this win an dhis players did ,, not only gg,Gambhir is the anti choking giga Chad. Was the best batsman in both wc finals we won. Nerves of steel.,Indians praising something/someone without dragging something/someone down challenge: IMPOSIBLE,GG has the right mentality,KKR is a super team,SRH is a mediocre team that got carried by Cummins and a few others,Why Pat cares about a club team bro, he stole 2 trophies from ICT 🫠 and performed for his National side,Not only GG, but also   pandit and abhishek nayyar.,In order to win against a mastermind like Cummins we need another mastermind like GG.,Honestly Shreyas Iyer and head coach should be valued more not like GG is bad and all but his work is  like assistant coach so if fine players are having issues/ inconvenience/ sharpening or polishing the defined skills that's  the job of mentor ,Just my thoughts cause people are excluding Shreyas Iyer,The mentor didn't win the game, the team did,So ironic that GG was speaking out against hero worship and now people are doing it to him. Give the players some credit ffs.,"" ekk chake ne world cup nehi jeetaya he "" just saying,Average Delhi guy with ego issues.,Why do you lot always wanna pick one individual from a team to dick ride?  No wonder ICT doesn't win shit, it's a team game ffs.,GG is great in many ways, but his “I’m so different from everyone “ shtick is very cringe lmao. Like when he said Rashford over CR7/Messi. Dude tries too hard to be alag. Plus he’s been a failure of a politician.,EPIC,Not sure if people saying, ""it's not a 1 person thing"", stick to the other similar scenarios as well. Yes it's true though that it was a team effort., but mentorship and coaching does count a good %. So credits go to GG as well., He rocks in this role.,GG is the ultimate Gigachad.,Ahh people are treating him the way GG never wanted to be treated and have been very much critical of hero worshiping.,Instilling winning mentality is so important. Many teams do well until the knockout stage and then underperform, but this KKR unit didn’t lose steam. GG is phenomenal, so is every other member, even the ones who don’t play contribute in ways we cannot imagine. I desperately wanted an Indian captain to clinch the title against a proven winner like Cummins. What a win!,Srh was in the last position last year, to go to the final is an amazing achievement Cummins you beauty,24 cr were worth it and 20 cr too🥶🥶,He is the special one - Jose M,He will teach the team on how to cry for everything,WC mai le jao,anything to get us the cup,All the teams he mentored went to playoffs,Chandrakant Pandit left the chat,Final boss,Why are you all giving credit to him its a team effort - GG,Pat Cummins started to win Big events recently ( end of 22- 23 end ),While gambhir already coached kkr and won them 2 trophies 10 years ago.,So tactically gambhir was superior to Cummins.,But it's not even Cummins fault, head got scared of Starc and whole SRH batting line-up crumbled.,But still SRH finished 10 , 8 and now they were in final.,Hopefully if Cummins stays they will win atleast one trophy.,ICT team needs that gambhir mentality.,Panga Lena hi kyu bekar me mai toh pehle hi bola tha Bina game ke trophy dedo bekar me beizzati hogyi SRH ki,If someone still doubts whether he shouldn't be the indian head coach. Pls kill yourself.,GG and co. bol,""ek chhakke ne match nahi jitaya."" ,We cannot credit GG for this win entirely however for building this team he has lion's share.,ek coach ne ipl nahi jitaya comment incoming,Too good a team, not undermining GG, but too good a team.,Why is a captain compared with a coach? Shouldn't it be Pat vs Iyer?,People will forget about this ipl win in next 2 days but nobody will forget how pat won the world cup!",https://i.redd.it/wt8f20rl1t2d1.jpeg,What Are Your Thoughts On Gautam Gambhir As A Mentor?,https://old.reddit.com/r/ipl/
